        <p>Very good service, good menu … not overly extensive. Food was very good quality all around. They know how to prepare home fries and their omelets are top-notch. Prices were reasonable.”</p>

      <p>I had breakfast there this morning and dinner tonight. All were well beyond my expectations. Everything is so fresh. Best clam chowder I have ever had. Clams and linguine were out of this world. Breakfast will knock your slippers off.</p>
