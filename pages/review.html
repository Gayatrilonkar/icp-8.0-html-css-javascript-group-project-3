        <p>Very good service, good menu ‚Ä¶ not overly extensive. Food was very good quality all around. They know how to prepare home fries and their omelets are top-notch. Prices were reasonable.‚Äù</p>

      <p>I had breakfast there this morning and dinner tonight. All were well beyond my expectations. Everything is so fresh. Best clam chowder I have ever had. Clams and linguine were out of this world. Breakfast will knock your slippers off.</p>

      <p>I liked the ambience and the food equally. The food quality is really upmarket.The prices are okay. I liked kulfi in rabdi and also the rotis which were soft. The food is not too spicy and not too light. There is balance of taste.

      <p>Normally wings are wings, but theirs are lean meaty and tender, and delicious homemade teriaki glaze. Gluten free pizza way better than most. Great wait staff too.Came here after finding the best gluten free muffins anywhere.
